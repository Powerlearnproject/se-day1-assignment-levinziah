Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It a systemic approach to designing,developing,testing and maintaining software using engineering principles to ensure reliability,efficiency and sclability.
IMPORTANCeE IN THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY:It ensures reliability by facilitating production of robust applications with minimal failures.
fosters efficiency by enhancing software resilience  against cyber threats. 
Scalability ensures software can handle increased work loads.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
	1.1950s-1960s: Birth of Programming & Structured Programming
	•	Early programming languages like FORTRAN, COBOL, and ALGOL were developed.
	•	Introduction of structured programming improved readability and maintainability.
	2.	1970s-1980s: Software Crisis & Standardization
	•	The software crisis highlighted the need for better development methodologies.
	•	Waterfall model introduced, followed by methodologies like Spiral and V-Model.
	•	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) emerged (Smalltalk, C++).
	3.	1990s-Present: Agile, DevOps, and AI in Software Engineering
	•	Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban) replaced rigid Waterfall 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
	1.Requirement Analysis: Gather and define system requirements.
	2.	Planning: Define project scope, timeline, and cost estimation.
	3.	Design: Create system architecture and user interface prototypes.
	4.	Implementation (Coding): Developers write the actual code.
	5.	Testing: Identify and fix bugs before deployment.
	6.	Deployment: Release the software for user access.
	7.	Maintenance: Apply updates, security patches, and improvements.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  1.Software Developer: Writes, tests, and maintains code.
	2.Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Ensures software meets quality standards through testing.
	3.Project Manager: Oversees project scope, timeline, and team coordination.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  •	Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Provide tools for efficient coding (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ, PyCharm).
  •	Version Control Systems (VCS): Track code changes, enabling collaboration and rollback (e.g., Git, GitHub, GitLab).
Example:
	•	IDE: A Java developer uses IntelliJ for writing and debugging code.
	•	VCS: A team uses GitHub to collaborate on an open-source project.



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  1.	Managing Complexity → Use modular programming and design patterns.
	2.	Software Bugs → Implement thorough testing and debugging.
	3.	Meeting Deadlines → Use Agile and DevOps practices.
	4.	Security Vulnerabilities → Follow secure coding practices and regular security audits.
	5.	Team Collaboration Issues → Use project management tools (JIRA, Trello).


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 
1. Unit Testing: Tests individual code units (e.g testing a function).
2.Integration Testing: Ensures modules work together (e.g database and frontend).
3.System Testing: Tests the entire system as a whole (e.g. user login process).
4.Acceptance Testing: Validates software against business requirements before release.

Importance: Prevents defects, ensures reliability, and improves user experience.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting precise inputs (prompts) to get optimal outputs from AI models such as ChatGPT.
It’s crucial for:Maximizing AI performance,Reducing ambiguity in responses and Improving automation and efficiency.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: Tell me about AI.
Improved Prompt: Explain Artificial Intelligence, including its key types and real-world applications. This prompt is better because:More specific as it focuses on AI types and applications,guides AI response and gives More effective output.
